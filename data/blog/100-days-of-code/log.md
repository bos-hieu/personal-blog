### Day 0: April 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Thinking about what I want to do for the next 100 days.

**Thoughts:** I just completed my first semester of Cloud Computing and Blockchain. Therefore, I will be focusing on these two areas for the next 100 days. The main goal is to practice the concept by doing labs, projects, and reading articles.
The programs I will be using are:
- [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Golang](https://golang.org/)
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)
