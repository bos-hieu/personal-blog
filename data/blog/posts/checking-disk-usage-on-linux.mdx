## Checking Disk Usage on Linux

To check disk usage on a Linux system, you can use several commands depending on what information you need. Here are a few common commands:

### 1. Check Disk Usage of the Entire Filesystem

```bash
df -h
```

The `df` command reports file system disk space usage. The `-h` option makes the output human-readable, displaying sizes in KB, MB, or GB.

### 2. Check Disk Usage of a Specific Directory

```bash
du -sh /path/to/directory
```

The `du` command estimates file space usage. The `-s` option provides a summary of the disk usage for the directory. The `-h` option makes the output human-readable.

### 3. Check Disk Usage by Top Largest Files and Directories

```bash
du -ah /path/to/directory | sort -rh | head -n 10
```

This command lists the top 10 largest files and directories in the specified directory. The `-a` option includes files in the output, not just directories. The `sort` command sorts the output, and `head` limits the list to the top 10.

### 4. Check Inode Usage

```bash
df -i
```

The `-i` option with `df` shows inode usage, which is helpful if you are running out of inodes (the number of files) rather than disk space.
